1.what you have doneï¼š
Do the BSA thing in linked list.
Inside every Node, there is a element named indx, which is the indx in the ordinary BSA.
Every time we set a Node, just connect it to the previous linked list or insert it .
2.the motivation
(1)Linked lists can dynamically grow and shrink, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.
(2)The space is only allocated when created a new Node. It saves memory.
Each element in a linked list can be allocated independently, enabling efficient memory usage, especially when the size is unpredictable.
3.how well it works in practice (or not)
* Runtime:
Total time taken: 0.000004 seconds in BSA
Total time taken: 0.000098 seconds in Linked list
Linked List is still slightly slower than BSA.
* Memory:
1,760 bytes allocated in BSA.
total heap usage: 10 allocs, 10 frees, 5,344 bytes allocated
4.comparing it with the original BSA
linked list version of it actually have more advantages in memory management, but
